          <h2>Elevating the Outdoor Shopping Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a Senior Product Designer, I led the transformative redesign of
            Duck Camp's e-commerce platform, blending traditional retail with
            innovative, user-centric design. I aimed to enrich the online
            shopping experience, focusing on customer education and
            decision-making, particularly for hunting gear choices based on
            specific pursuits and technical specifications.

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>
            I led the comprehensive overhaul of Duck Camp's e-commerce platform,
            enhancing the user experience through an interactive system builder
            and detailed product weight info to increase cart size and enrich
            the shopping experience. My role also involved strategic growth,
            expanding women's products, and editorial content.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Duck Camp's challenge was incrementally improving the e-commerce
            platform to engage users and improve conversion rates. The goal was
            to create an intuitive and rich online experience catering to
            hunting enthusiasts' unique preferences and requirements.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            To tackle Duck Camp's challenges, I created an Interactive System
            Builder for outfit customization, detailed product weight
            information for informed choices, and inclusive marketing modules
            for the women's product line, enhancing user experience and aligning
            with brand ethos.

              <p>
                My approach emphasized collaborative leadership. I worked
                closely with various teams, including marketing for the women's
                product line, ensuring that each group's insights contributed to
                the final design. This collaborative process was crucial in
                achieving a cohesive and successful redesign.

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                Success was measured through increased cart size, improved
                conversion rates, and positive customer feedback. These metrics
                indicated that the redesign met and exceeded our goals,
                highlighting the effectiveness of the new features and overall
                UX improvements.

              <p>
                My work directly contributed to Duck Camp's growth by improving
                the online shopping experience, which led to increased sales and
                customer satisfaction. Introducing features catering to a
                broader demographic, including women, also helped expand the
