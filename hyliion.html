          <h2>Electrified Trucking Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my journey with Hyliion, where innovation meets
            practicality in commercial trucking. Over two exciting years, I
            played a pivotal role as the lead engineer in software design,
            focusing on creating the Hyliion ERX's Copilot software. This
            cutting-edge Human-Machine Interface (HMI) empowers vehicle
            operators to seamlessly monitor and control the electric aspects of
            the ERX system, marking a significant leap in trucking technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simultaneously, I architected and designed Hyliion's comprehensive
            fleet management system, HUB. This system, which I meticulously
            defined and built, serves dual purposes: catering to various
            internal engineering requirements and providing an external,
            customer-facing platform. Through this, I have helped bridge the gap
            between intricate engineering and user-centric design, ensuring that
            internal teams and external users benefit from a coherent,
            efficient, and intuitive experience.

          <h2>Establishing Foundations for Harmonious Digital Experiences</h2>
          <p>
            At Hyliion, I focused on three key goals: redefining user experience, establishing robust UX practices, and shifting from a technology-centric to a user-centric design philosophy. This approach led to the creation of intuitive, accessible, and advanced digital products, significantly enhancing user experiences and advancing our software design approach in the commercial trucking industry.
          </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Defining and Advocating User-Centered Design</strong>
              Recognizing the need for a shift to User-Centered Design at Hyliion, I championed the UCD approach in software development, clarifying the essence of UX and advocating for designs driven by user needs and behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Establishing a Scalable Design Framework</strong>
              I established a scalable design language and system at Hyliion, setting the foundation for a unified and adaptable user experience across all digital interfaces. This strategy was crucial for the consistent and flexible evolution of our future digital products.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Implementing a Comprehensive User Research Program</strong>
              I initiated a comprehensive user research program at Hyliion to validate design assumptions, starting with internal test drivers and expanding to include customer feedback during fleet trials. Employing methodologies like contextual inquiries, usability studies, and interviews, this program provided essential insights for product development and emphasized the importance of regular, early engagement with end-users for direct feedback.

                    <strong>Innovative HMI Design Initiatives</strong>
                    Building on a strong UCD foundation, our team introduced modern and innovative HMI designs, driven by a collective effort to integrate changes based on quantitative and qualitative research. This collaborative approach ensured our products were not only technologically advanced but also intuitive and user-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Architecting the HUB Fleet Management Tool</strong>
                    In my expanded role at Hyliion, I led a team effort in designing digital products for both our brand and marketing. Together, we developed a digital style guide, a key tool for guiding external vendors and partners in creating digital experiences that aligned with Hyliion’s UX standards. This ensured consistent quality across all our digital touchpoints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Comprehensive Support for Internal Teams and Processes</strong>
                    My responsibilities at Hyliion grew to include leading digital product design for both our brand and marketing. I created a digital style guide that guided external vendors and partners, ensuring consistency and high UX standards across all digital touchpoints.
