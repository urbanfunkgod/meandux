        <h1>Functional Impact: Is a Process</h1>
        <p>
          In my approach to UX design, I believe in the harmony of form and
          function, where every element serves a purpose and enhances the user's
          journey. Rooted in empathy, I prioritize understanding users' needs,
          aspirations, and behaviors, ensuring that every interaction is
          intuitive, meaningful, and delightful. Design is more than aesthetics;
          it's about crafting experiences that resonate, empower, and make a
          lasting impact.
